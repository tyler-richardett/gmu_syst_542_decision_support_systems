# myScout: Decision Support System for Scouting Talent and Weighing Competing Objectives

As part of a course project, I worked with a group of students to envision and construct a prototype decision support system (DSS). [Now deployed](https://tricha3.shinyapps.io/myScout/), our DSS intends to pair professional soccer players’ event-level data with multi-criteria decision analysis methods &mdash; resulting in a system which “assists clubs with the identification, scouting, and acquisition of world-class talent,” as we state in our initial proposal.
